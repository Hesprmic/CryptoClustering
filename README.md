# CryptoClustering
Started off by uploading the data involving cryptocurrency and scaled the dataframe to ready for determining the best value for k. This was achieved by plotting the data in an elbow curve. Next I initialized the k means model and fit the data to create a scatterplot. Created a PCA model and optimized the clusters for it. Using that PCA data find a k value and make another elbow curve. This leads into making a scatter plot with the cluster from the PCA data. Finally these two graphs (elbow curve and scatter plots) are compared from the original data and the PCA model data.
